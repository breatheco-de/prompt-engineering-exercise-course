# Importance of Detailed Instructions 📝

Great! You have started interacting with the AI and you already understand how prompts work. Now, it's time to delve into the importance of providing detailed instructions in your prompts.

Let's explore why providing detailed instructions in prompts is crucial for obtaining precise and relevant results from the AI. By the end of this lesson, you will understand how to refine and improve your initial prompts to get better results.

### Why Detailed Instructions Matter 🤔

When you provide detailed instructions in your prompts, you help the AI understand exactly what you need. This leads to more precise and relevant results. Let's look at examples to illustrate this:

**Bad Prompt**

> Write a story about entrepreneurship.


**Good Prompt**

> Write a 300-word story about a young entrepreneur who starts a tech company. The story should include the challenges he faces, how he overcomes them, and his eventual success. Focus on the character's growth and resilience. The tone should be inspiring and motivational. The main character should be a 32-year-old man named Alfonso.


In the bad example, the prompt is too vague, leading to a generic and possibly irrelevant story. In the good example, the detailed instructions guide the AI to produce a more focused and useful story.

### How to Refine Your Prompts 🛠️

Refining your prompts involves adding specific details and requirements. You should ask yourself questions like:

- What is the structure of the result I want?
- What tone should the result have?
- Are there specific elements or themes I want to include?
- Who is the target audience for the result?

By answering these questions and incorporating the details into your prompt, you can guide the AI to generate results that meet your expectations.

> Note: It is important to know what you want to achieve when interacting with an AI. It is not simply about passing any text and expecting a perfect result, but you must guide it to deliver what you need.
