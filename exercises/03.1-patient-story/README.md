# Creating a Detailed Medical History 🏥

It's action time! In this exercise, you will need to fix a prompt that doesn't work to generate a more detailed and useful result. You will have to put yourself in the shoes of a healthcare professional and create a detailed medical history for an imaginary patient.

### Understanding the Current Prompt 🧐

Let's start by examining the current prompt:


### Create a Medical History:

> John Doe, a 45-year-old man, presented to the emergency department with a 2-day history of persistent chest pain. The pain is described as a pressure sensation, located in the center of the chest, and radiates to the left arm. The pain worsens with physical activity and is relieved by rest. He also reports shortness of breath, sweating, and nausea accompanying the chest pain.


Although this prompt provides useful information, it lacks the depth and structure needed for a detailed medical history. Let's see how we can improve it.
