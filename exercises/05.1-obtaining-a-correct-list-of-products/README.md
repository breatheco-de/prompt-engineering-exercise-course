# Get a Correct Product List

Now that you have learned about the different types of "shots" in prompt creation, let's put your skills to the test with a practical exercise.

### Scenario
Imagine that you and I are working on a product guide for an online store. We have a list of products with their descriptions, prices, and customer ratings. However, the current format is not very user-friendly, and we need to improve it to make it easier to read and understand.

This is the current format of the product list:

> ### Notebooks  
> A versatile tool for jotting down notes, ideas, and sketches.  
> **Price:** $5.99  
> **Customer Rating:** 4 out of 5 find them great for business use.  
> **Product Code:** `ntb-001`  
>
> ### Pens  
> High-quality pens designed for smooth and durable writing.  
> **Price:** $1.99  
> **Customer Rating:** 5 out of 5 recommend them for reliability and comfort.  
> **Product Code:** `pen-002`  
>
> ### Microphone  
> Professional-grade microphone ideal for recording, streaming, and online meetings.  
> **Price:** $49.99  
> **Customer Rating:** 4.5 out of 5 praise its sound clarity and ease of use.  
> **Product Code:** `mic-003`

## Instructions ðŸ“Œ
We want to improve our guide to obtain a more readable product list. We need a guide that includes for each product: name, price, customer rating, and product code in a format like:


> - **Notebooks**
>   - Price: $5.99
>   - Customer Rating: 4 out of 5
>   - Product Code: ntb-001

- Your task is to create a prompt that helps us get a correct product list in the desired format.
- Remember to use appropriate delimiters and provide clear instructions and the necessary context for the AI to understand the task.
- Use one of the following "shots": one-shot, few-shot, or many-shot, depending on the number of examples you think the AI needs to understand the task.
