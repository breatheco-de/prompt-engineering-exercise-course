# 04.1 - Fix the Failed Translation Prompt 🌐

It's time to test your skills in fixing prompts! In this exercise, you will encounter a failed translation prompt that needs your expert touch to make it clear and effective.

### Understanding the Problem 🧐

When creating prompts for translation, clarity is key. A poorly structured prompt can lead to incorrect or incomplete translations. Let's take a look at the failed prompt:

```

```

This prompt is confusing and lacks proper delimiters, making it difficult for the AI to understand what exactly needs to be translated, and even a human cannot understand it well.

## Instructions 📌

- Fix the prompt to get a correct translation of the exact text into Spanish. The text to be translated is:

```text

Good luck! 🎉
