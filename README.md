# Welcome to the Practical Prompt Engineering Course for Beginners 🤖🧾
In recent years, **Generative Artificial Intelligence** (AI) has taken an increasingly important role in the daily lives of many people. Since the release of **ChatGPT**, AI has ceased to be just a concept known to a few and has become an accessible tool for everyone, but still, many do not know how it works... That is about to change.

### In this course, we answer the following questions:
- How does Generative AI work?
- What are the best *Prompting* techniques to get precise results?
- How to obtain an API Key to use OpenAI or Groq

Additionally, we review many important concepts in a concise and clear manner so that anyone can understand them regardless of their prior knowledge.
